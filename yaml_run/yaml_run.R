### STEP 0: install packages

## needed only for package installation or update

# The aim of 'devtools' is to make package development easier by providing R functions that simplify common tasks.
libraries = c("devtools")
lapply(libraries, function(x) if (!(x %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages(x)
})
lapply(libraries, library, quietly = TRUE, character.only = TRUE)


## The devtools package provides install_github() that enables installing packages from GitHub.

# This command installs the yamldebugger package directly from GitHub,
# namely: https://github.com/lborke/yamldebugger
devtools::install_github("lborke/yamldebugger")


### STEP 1: once the yamldebugger package was installed you can start from this step everytime you want to debug new Quantlets

## load the package every time you want to use 'yamldebugger'
library(yamldebugger)

# Application example. Make sure you have some Q folders on your lokal disk for validating.
# Let 'workdir' be the folder where the Q folders are stored.
# You can take three Quantlet examples from the subfolder 'examples' of this Quantlet, put them into any lokal folder of your computer
# and adjust the parameter 'workdir' if necesarry.

workdir = "c:/test"
# workdir = "c:/.../examples"

## I: YAML initialization function: prepares and returns all data necesarry in the further process
d_init = yaml.debugger.init(workdir, show_keywords = TRUE)
# d_init = yaml.debugger.init(workdir, show_keywords = FALSE)

## II: Loads the list of Q folders. RootPath is required where the Qs are located.
qnames = yaml.debugger.get.qnames(d_init$RootPath)

## III: Main part of the YAML debugger. Loops trough the provided Q folders and extracts YAML meta info.
# If errors occur, corresponding error handling is executed.
d_results = yaml.debugger.run(qnames, d_init)

## IV: Overview of the parser results. If errors occured, the corresponding Q names and YAML errors are displayed.
OverView = yaml.debugger.summary(qnames, d_results, summaryType = "mini")

OverView = yaml.debugger.summary(qnames, d_results, summaryType = "compact")

OverView = yaml.debugger.summary(qnames, d_results, summaryType = "full")

# 'yaml.debugger.summary' provides 3 levels of detail : "mini", "compact", "full"

## You can also access the OverView structure via the variable 'OverView'

dim(OverView)

OverView[1,]
